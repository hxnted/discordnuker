- To use this nuker you have to do some very simple things.
- First off, create an application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Name it whatever you want, just don't make it obvious its a nuke bot.
- When you've done that, you should be here:

- Click on the bar called "Bot"
- And turn all of the intents ON:

- Obviously you have to make sure to save it.
- Then scroll up a bit until you are here:

- When you are there, click on Reset Token and reset it.

- You should now see this long text, make sure to copy it and to not loose it.
- Note: Do not share your bot token unless you want people to have access to your bot.

- Now, download the bot.py file and open it in Visual Studio Code.
- You can change the code to whatever you like, but try not to mess with it too much.
- Now scroll to the bottom of the code, and you should see this:
![image](https://github.com/hxnted/discordnuker/assets/135558337/e0e6dc60-bade-40f0-aff0-c8a768361a75)
- Paste the token that you had earlier, into where it says 'bot token'

- Now go back to the Discord Dev Portal, and go to OAuth, and then URL Generator

- In the scopes, make sure to tick "bot" (should be in the middle)
- Then scroll down and tick Administrator

- Make sure to copy this URL at the bottom, and paste it into your browser.
- It should bring you here:

- Add it to the server you want to nuke.
- If your desired server doesn't show up, then you don't have permissions to add the bot there, and therefore can't nuke it.

- Once you've added the bot to your server, go back into VS Code and click on this button in the top right:
![image](https://github.com/hxnted/discordnuker/assets/135558337/acd3714d-a2ad-4eca-ba72-f6487a423989)
- If it says this in the bottom (Terminal), then you've done it correctly:
![image](https://github.com/hxnted/discordnuker/assets/135558337/4a4acc6e-d200-4acb-9bb2-4444b77da443)

- You should notice that the Bot is now online, so now you can run the command !protect (THIS WILL NUKE THE SERVER)
![image](https://github.com/hxnted/discordnuker/assets/135558337/94a57acd-22cd-45a4-850c-794f5d5c128f)

- And you may notice, in the terminal, it says "Global rate limit has been hit.", so make sure to only do this command every 5 or so minutes, or your bot/you could get termed.
